<h1>Salina Thapa</h1>

My website is a personal portfolio for employers to look through my CV and assess my skills at a beginner. 

Employers will be able to use my website for information about myself, my career history, see how my current skills are, and contact me if they're interested.

It will be a work in progress site that I will slowly keep adding onto so I can showcase my skills as they improve.

<h3>Testing</h3>

<p>When I initially tested my site and submitted it, it turns out that nothing had been pushed hence why my site wasn't loading. Thanfully, I was able to recover most data and change up the style of my webpage for a more accessible look because of this.</p>
